# GSSE - GreyScript Script Extender

**GreyScript Script Extender (GSSE)** is a modular library designed to enhance and expand the existing scripting capabilities of the GreyScript framework. By providing a flexible and extensible architecture, GSSE enables developers to build more powerful and feature-rich scripts within the GreyScript ecosystem.

We welcome community involvementâ€”**feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or make contributions**

A bundle with all of the scripts in one file is located inside the build folder.
